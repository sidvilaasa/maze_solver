Solving mazes has long been a fascinating challenge, from exploring garden hedge mazes to solving logical puzzles. With modern computing, algorithms make this process faster and more precise. In this post, we'll delve into implementing a maze solver in C++ using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, showcasing its efficiency and simplicity.

DFS:
Depth-First Search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, which makes it ideal for maze-solving problems. The core idea is to start at the root (or any arbitrary node), explore each branch to its deepest point, and then backtrack to explore the next branch.

working:
This program solves a maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and is implemented in C++. It begins by taking input from the user for the maze dimensions, the maze grid itself, and the starting position. The maze is represented as a 2D grid, where 0 indicates a valid path, 1 represents a wall, and 2 marks the goal. Input validation ensures that the maze dimensions are positive, that the maze contains at least one goal (2), and that the starting position is valid (either a path or the goal).

Before attempting to solve the maze, the program displays its initial state using the printMaze function. The solving process then begins with the solveMaze function, which uses a recursive DFS approach. Starting from the provided position, the function explores all four possible directions—right, left, down, and up—checking each cell for validity. A cell is considered valid if it lies within the maze boundaries and is either a path (0) or the goal (2). If the function encounters the goal, it returns true, indicating that a solution has been found. During this process, cells along the solution path are marked with -1. If no path exists, the function backtracks by resetting cells to their original state (0).

Once the solving process is complete, the program displays the maze again. If a solution exists, the path to the goal is marked, and the result is displayed. If no path is found, the program informs the user accordingly.

This program is robust in handling errors, ensuring proper inputs and validating the maze structure before solving. It demonstrates the efficiency of DFS in exploring and solving mazes while providing clear feedback on the maze's state before and after solving. The use of recursive backtracking ensures that all possible paths are explored, making it a reliable approach to solving maze problems.
