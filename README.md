Solving mazes has long been a fascinating challenge, from exploring garden hedge mazes to solving logical puzzles. With modern computing, algorithms make this process faster and more precise. In this post, we'll delve into implementing a maze solver in C++ using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, showcasing its efficiency and simplicity.

DFS:
Depth-First Search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, which makes it ideal for maze-solving problems. The core idea is to start at the root (or any arbitrary node), explore each branch to its deepest point, and then backtrack to explore the next branch.
